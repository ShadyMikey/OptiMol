    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "In the chemistry community, density function theory (DFT) is the major tool set for chemical property prediction. However, it requires users of quantum mechanics specialty and demands a substantial computational hardware facility to achieve an approximal predition. These two prerequisites are not accessible for most of the chemists and materials scientists who are spearheading in chemical and material discoveries. This gap has significantly slowed down the pace of technology innovation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the light of the fast advancement of machine learning (ML), it can now make decisions or predictions without explicit instructions, but based on sample data. In the project we are experiementing to utilize ML to predict molecular conformation of organic chemicals based on the crystallographic information data, which has been accomulated by the chemistry community over the decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, this package's purpose is provide tools to predict 3D molecular conformation from 2D drawings, for chemists and material scientists who don't possess a sufficient quantum mechanics backgrounds."

    "The demography of users of this package would be mainly chemists, researchers and scientists working in the field of organic crystals and molecular structures. The users are expected to have advance knowledge of chemistry, but programming is not required. Machine learning would help in fine tuning the model to specific need, but it is not neccessary for general usage of this package.\n",

    "The user can provide a 2D design of a molecule structure that contains the information of X-Y coordinates and atom connections. The 2D input can easily be made using chemtistry softwares and [online tool](http://www.cheminfo.org/Chemistry/Generate_molfiles/index.html).\n",

First part is that we use existing molecules from ChemSpider to generate 2D coordinate, 2D bond type,  3D coordinate, 3D bond type as training data. With those information, we can feed our dataset to XGboost maching learning Algorithm and output the 3D design model."
