    "# Component Specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "# <u>Component Breakdown</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "## The package contains two main module, **data_compile.py** and  **model.py** \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **data_compile.py** - Data processing module\n",
    "\n",
    "Module contains multiple functions to serve all purposes of processing and manipulate raw data from molecular databases and user's end. In general, There are three categories that functions fall into:\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Database setup:</u> **database_setup()**, **sample_subset()** and **get_id()** : These functions setup database folder for storing molecules retrieved from ChemSpiPy server, create smaller sample sets for testing, and as well as keeping id list for later handling.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<u>Function wrapper and input reader:</u> **get_df()**, **df_cleaner()**, **get_df_database()**, **get_df_user()**, **get_all_dataset()** are for reading user input and database files. The inputs are generally in text file format, from both user and database. It requires going through several steps to acquire proper dataframe format. This step is necessary for latter data manipulation before input to model.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Data manipulation:</u> **trim_hydrogen()**, **atom_connect()**, **atom_periodic_number_convert()** are for trimming unnecessary data and compute information for model input from raw values. Within the data files that contains 3D information, location of Hydrogens are often not know. Therefore, it is necessary to remove them from the data sets. Other information like how each atoms connect to one another are crucial for identifying the relative locations between atoms. Last but not least, by converting the atom symbol from string type to integer, it would reduce possiblity of error when the model take those values into account during the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **model.py** - Machine learning model module\n",
    "Module contains multiple functions before feeding into maching learning :XGboost. In general, There are three categories that functions fall into:\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Read Dataframe:</u> **get_user_df()**: This function helps to read demo datafrme into csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Data Preparation:</u> **get_centroid(coord_matrix)**, **translation_centroid(coord_matrix)**, **get_max_dist(coord_matrix)**, **unit_vector(vector)**, **angle_between(v1, v2)**, **rotation_matrix_2d(theta)**, **absmax_index(a,axis=None)**, **translate_rotate_2d(coord_2d)**, **rotation_matrix_from_vectors(vec1, vec2)**, **rotation_around_x(axis, theta)**, **translate_rotate_3d(x_index, y_index, coord_3d)** are our algorithm for predicting 3d strucutre. The inputs are generally about the compound's basic properties such us their bond type. It requires several steps to tell the computer how to connect atoms with particular bond type. According to the background knowledge, each element countains different bond type. Therefore, we need to follow the principles. \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Train model:</u> **build_model()**, **get_model(data)**, **model_eval(model,data,n_fold=5)**, **predict_3d(user_input,model)** are for training the model using XGboost. With these function we can obtain training model and tune the parameter in XGBoost to gain the better accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Data source\n",
    "The database used for this package was a part of [ChemSpider](http://www.chemspider.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "User input can easily be made from [this online tool](http://www.cheminfo.org/Chemistry/Generate_molfiles/index.html)\n"
